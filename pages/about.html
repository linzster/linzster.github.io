    I am the Assistant Director of the Franklin College Writing Intensive Program at the University of Georgia. I serve as the faculty advisor and editor for The Classic, the Writing Intensive Program's journal of undergraduate writing and research. I am also the lead developer and designer for Mandala Journal, a publication of the Institute for African American Studies at UGA. This year, I was selected to participate in the Franklin College Online Learning Fellows program. During the 2015-2016 academic year, I will teach Advanced Compsition (in Face-to-Face and online environments) and Writing for the Web. My writing, teaching, and research interests include writing studies, digital writing and rhetoric, creative writing, and digital humanities.

    In May 2015, I graduated from the University of Georgia with my Ph.D. in English. My dissertation “Motherhood Collection: A Critical-Creative Study of Domestic Photography in the Digital Age” involves investigations into domestic photography and motherhood. Prior to beginning my doctorate program at UGA, I taught high school English for five years at an independent school in Gainesville, Florida. In May 2011, I graduated from Sewanee University’s School of Letters with my M.F.A. in creative writing. Part of my heart still resides on the Domain. In 2004, I graduated from Columbia University with my B.A. in English.
