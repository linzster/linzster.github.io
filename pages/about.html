    I'm a Ph.D. candidate at The University of Georgia. My writing, teaching, and research interests include rhetoric and composition, creative writing, and digital humanities. I currently work as the assistant to the director for the <a href='http://wip.uga.edu/'>Writing Intensive Program</a> at UGA.

    In 2004, I graduated from Columbia University with my B.A. in English. I then taught high school English for five years at an independent school in Gainesville, Florida. In May 2011, I graduated from Sewanee Universityâ€™s School of Letters with my M.F.A. in creative writing. Part of my heart still resides on the Domain.

    I now have three manuscripts (story collection, pseudo-history novella, and novel) that I'm working to get published. Fingers crossed. I've been studying transfer in writing-intensive classes and <a href='http://prezi.com/'>Prezi</a> as a space for multimodal composition. My dissertation project involves creative and critical investigations into domestic photography, motherhood, and mourning.

    I live in Athens, Georgia, with my husband and our three small children. In my free time (ha!), I work on literary and academic web projects, swim with my family at the YMCA, and watch television on Netflix.
